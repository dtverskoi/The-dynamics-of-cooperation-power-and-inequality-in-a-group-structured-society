function2.m is a Matlab implementation of the model for the case of groups with identical sizes (the degree of rivalrousness is assumed to be equal 1).
This function automatically simulates the model 100 runs and shows the results on the number of cooperating groups Coop, the Gini index of inequality 
among them Gini, and the standard deviation of efforts among them StdX.

Fig5_data.m performs simulations that are required for the Figure 5. It uses function2 for creating data. All the output files should be kept in the same folder.

Figure5.m plots Figure 5 using data created by the program file Fig5_data.m. This code also uses program files boundedline.m, confplot.m, inpaint_nans.m, 
outlinebounds.m and singlepatch.m created by Kelly Kearney (Kelly Kearney (2020). boundedline.m (https://github.com/kakearney/boundedline-pkg), GitHub.

LICENSE.txt corresponds to boundedline.m, confplot.m, inpaint_nans.m, outlinebounds.m, and singlepatch.m.
